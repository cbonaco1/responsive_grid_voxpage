A good grid system has 4 important elements:
-container
-rows
-columns
-gutters -- space between each column

100 - (# of gutters * width of each gutter) = x

(100-x) / (# of columns) = width of each column


Psuedo-Elements
-used to specify parts of an element
Ex:
p:first-line {
	color:red;
}

makes the first line of a p element red.

:before, :after
-places stuff before/after specfied elements


10/25 Meeting with Kyle:
nav-bar issue:
apply float:left to top-nav and make width 100%

10/30
position:relative/fixed

fixed - setting position of an element regardless of those around it. hardcoding position.
